        <h1>Whirlwind trip to the Beautiful Guatemala</h1>
        <p>In a matter of less than a week's time, I was on my way to Guatemala City, ready to serve, as much as possible, as an interpreter for a maternal and infant health training for Guatemalan doctors and nurses. As a native Spanish speaker, I thought I had this assignment in the bag, until I saw the details of the curriculum - so many medical terms I hardly knew the meaning of in English, much less in Spanish. <i> This would be quite the learning curve!</i></p>
        <p>I turned to a favorite spanish quote of mine from Antonio Machado - <q> Caminante no hay camino. Se hace el camino al andar. </q> I would be making some of this up as I went, and that, in many respects, builds character. Could I handle not having the right word or phrase and keep on dancing through the interpretation process? Only time would tell. </p>
        <p><a href="http://www.providence.org/about/providence-health-international"> Providence Health International</a> made this trip possible. They team up with <a href="http://www.medicalteams.org">Medical Teams International</a> to provide continuing support to the same region. It is useful to have an on the ground group that fosters relationships and builds trust in the community we may be serving in.</p>
