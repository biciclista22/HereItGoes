        <h1>Hello World: Welcome to my First Web Page.</h1>
        <p>This is the first HTML code I write using what I have learned from FreeCodeCamp and the book _HTML&CSS_. I am also watching YouTube videos to begin the process of understanding how to commit and make changes with Git. There seem to be a lot of languages and processes one needs to learn to improve in this field.</p>
        <p>My initial impression is that this gives some immense design and creative license. In many respects, I wish I would have known this existed and that I could combine various interests. Alas, my personality type and initially defeatist attitude of - this is not something I can do- kept me from exploring that possibility, until now.</p>
